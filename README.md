# ChainlitQ-A

ChainlitQ-A is an open-source Python application that leverages the Chainlit framework to create a conversational AI capable of answering user queries. This project demonstrates how to build a chatbot interface using Chainlit, enabling seamless interactions with users.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: Engages users in dialogue, processing their input and providing appropriate responses.
- **Chainlit Integration**: Utilizes the Chainlit framework to manage message handling and user interactions.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Handles messages asynchronously to ensure efficient and responsive communication.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Chainlit package

You can install Chainlit using pip:

```bash
pip install chainlit
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanujkumar24/ChainlitQ-A-main.git
   cd ChainlitQ-A-main
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure all required packages are installed:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   Start the Chainlit application using the following command:

   ```bash
   chainlit run app.py -w
   ```

   The `-w` flag enables auto-reloading, allowing the server to restart automatically upon detecting code changes.

4. **Access the Chatbot Interface**:

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to interact with the chatbot.

## Application Structure

The core functionality resides in the `app.py` file, which includes:

- **Importing Chainlit**:

  ```python
  import chainlit as cl
  ```

- **Message Handling**:

  The `main` function is decorated with `@cl.on_message`, indicating it processes incoming messages:

  ```python
  @cl.on_message
  async def main(message: cl.Message):
      # Custom logic to process the message
      response = f"Received: {message.content}"
      await cl.Message(content=response).send()
  ```

  This function receives user messages, processes them, and sends back a response.

## Customization

To tailor the chatbot's behavior:

- **Modify Response Logic**: Adjust the `main` function in `app.py` to change how messages are processed and responses are generated.
- **Enhance Functionality**: Integrate additional libraries or APIs to expand the chatbot's capabilities, such as connecting to external databases or incorporating machine learning models.

## Resources
